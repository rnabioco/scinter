# scinter 
Examples of converting a Seurat object to various single cell visualization platforms

To start, download a few files. `cd` to the project directory and run the following in `R`
```r
source("download_files.R")
```


Then you should be able to run the `prep_*()` scripts for each visualization technology. 

Note that you will need to install the packages listed in the `library` calls to run
the scripts.
